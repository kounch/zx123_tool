== Introduction

[.text-center]
image:../img/Logo.jpg[pdfwidth=20%]

ZX123 Tool is a tool that analyzes, extracts and injects data in SPI flash image files for ZX-Uno, ZXDOS and similar devices.

These are its main features:

- List the contents of a ZX-Uno, etc. SPI flash image, showing, if possible, the version of BIOS, esxdos, main Spectrum core and optional cores, Spectrum ROMs and several BIOS settings
- Extract BIOS, esxdos ROM, Spectrum core and/or other cores, Spectrum ROMs to individual files
- Change some BIOS default options (video mode, keyboard layout, default core, default ROM, etc.)
- Add or replace FPGA cores and/or Spectrum ROM images (from individual ROM files or RomPack files)
- If supplied a different kind of file (like a core or BIOS installation file) it will also try to identify its contents
- For secondary cores, show information about some of the features that they may have (e.g. VGA video out, joystick support, supported SD or microSD formats, etc.)
- Wipe with zeros all Cores and ZX Spectrum ROMs data
- Create a copy of the flash image and, optionally, and/or truncate some (or all) of the optional cores (command line only)
- List, add or extract ROMs from a ROMPack v2 file (command line only)

It uses internally a file <<#_json_file,`zx123_hash.json`>> with the block structure of image files and, optionally, data to identify those blocks. If it is not found, it will try to download it from the repository on GitHub.

== Installation

There are different versions of the tool, one that works in a lot of platforms, but that may need to install Python 3, and other versions that doesn't need it, but aren't available for all systems.

=== MacOS

The MacOS binary isn't digitally signed, so you have to authorize the operating system to open de app, using the Finder contextual menu and choosing "Open".

[.text-center]
image:../img/MacOpenEN.jpg[pdfwidth=50%]

Alternatively, you can remove the quarantine attribute from the Terminal with a command like `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "ZX123 Tool.app"`.

=== Windows

The Windows binary release requires Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015 installed on your system and, for Windows 7, also Microsoft Quality Rollup KB4457144 or later.

Once extracted, you have to run from the program (`ZX123 Tool.exe`) using Python 3.

<<<

=== All platforms

To use the tool this way, you need https://www.python.org/[Python 3] to use it. Depending on the operating system you may have to https://www.python.org/downloads/[install it]. It has to be version 3.8 or later.

Having Python 3, you only need to download the latest version of the tool from the official repository, following https://github.com/kounch/zx123_tool/releases/latest[this link].

Once extracted, you have to run from a shell the main script (`ZX123 Tool.py`) using Python 3. This may change depending on the operating system.

For example, on Windows, it's usually:

[source,shell]
----
py -3 "ZX123 Tool.py"
----

With other operating systems it is normally like:

[source,shell]
----
python3 "./ZX123 Tool.py"
----

== Use

=== Graphical user interface

The interface is based on a single window configured like this:

[.text-center]
image:../img/MainWindow.jpg[pdfwidth=70%]

There's also a menu where you can access options to create a new SPI flash image file, open an existing file (either image or other kind) to analyze or edit (only if it's a flash image), wipe with zeros all the cores and ROMs data, expand a 16MB ZXDOS+ image to 32MB, stop editing, <<#_update_an_image,update the contents of an image>>, convert between main and secondary core (and vice versa), or show details for the currently selected core.

[.text-center]
image:../img/FileMenu.jpg[pdfwidth=50%]

<<<

When opening a non-image file, the tool will try to analyze and catalog it's contents and show the known details for it:

[.text-center]
image:../img/InfoWindow.jpg[pdfwidth=40%]

Once an image file is open to edit, it's possible to make the following modifications.

==== BIOS

Using the corresponding buttons, it is possible to export a file with the current BIOS (firmware) of the image, or to replace it (Import) with another one.

[.text-center]
image:../img/BIOS.jpg[pdfwidth=60%]

In addition, you can modify some of the default startup values.

[.text-center]
image:../img/DefaultBIOS.jpg[pdfwidth=25%]

For reference, these are the meanings of some of the values.

|===
|Setting
|Description
Boot Timer
|0 (No Timer), 1, 2, 3 or 4
|Keyboard Layout
|0 (Auto), 1 (ES), 2 (EN) or 3 (Spectrum)
|Video mode
|0 (PAL), 1 (NTSC) or 2 (VGA)
|===

==== esxdos

Using the corresponding buttons, it is possible to export a file with the current version of esxdos in the image, or to replace it (Import) with another one.

[.text-center]
image:../img/esxdos.jpg[pdfwidth=60%]

==== Spectrum Core

Using the corresponding buttons, it is possible to export a file with the current version of the Spectrum main core in the image, or to replace it (Import) with another one.

[.text-center]
image:../img/Spectrum.jpg[pdfwidth=100%]

==== Secondary cores

If no secondary core is selected in the list, it is possible to use the button to add a new one.

[.text-center]
image:../img/Cores.jpg[pdfwidth=25%]

When one or more cores are selected, it is possible to replace the first one with another one (Import) or to export each of the selected cores to separate files.

[.text-center]
image:../img/CoresSelect.jpg[pdfwidth=25%]

==== Spectrum ROMs

If no ROM is selected from the corresponding list, it is possible to use the Add button to add a new one. You can also replace or export all ROMs in the image using a single ROMPack file (v1).

[.text-center]
image:../img/ROMs.jpg[pdfwidth=100%]

When one or more ROMs are selected, it is possible to replace the first one with another one of the same size (Import) or to export each of the selected ROMs to separate files.

[.text-center]
image:../img/ROMsSelect.jpg[pdfwidth=100%]

<<<

When loading a ROM file, you can specify the flags to use when using the ROM, such as memory contention, DivMMC, timings of different Spectrum models, etc.

[.text-center]
image:../img/ROM.jpg[pdfwidth=80%]

The settings for each ROM are listed with a letter code that is explained in the <<#_rom_parameters,appendix at the end of this manual>>.

==== Update an image

From the menu, you can choose several options that try to update, either individually or all together, BIOS and cores to the latest version, according to the contents of the JSON file, being possible, when updating cores, to search for the ZX-Uno standard version, ZXUnCore (RGB666 DAC) adapted cores or 2MB internal memory adapted cores.

<<<

==== Preferences

On the preferences window you chan change the default behaviour for some actions of the application.

[.text-center]
image:../img/PrefsWindow.jpg[pdfwidth=60%]

- Automatically update the cores, ROMs, etc. database each time that the application is opened

- Check for new versions of the software, also each time that the application is opened

- Ask for a confirmation before applying changes when adding a new core or ROM

- Ask for a confirmation before applying changes when replacing the contents of an existing core or ROM

- Remember main window and preferences window positions (if not, both windows are always centered)

<<<

=== Command line interface

==== All platforms

The CLI can be invoked directly using the script `zx123_tool.py` and Python (version 3.6 or later), (e.g. `python3 zx123_tool.py -l -i FLASH.ZX1`)

==== MacOS

Alternatively, if your system does not have Python 3, you can call the MacOS binary from Terminal, addÃ­ng the parameter `--command` (e.g. `"/Applications/ZX123 Tool.app/Contents/MacOS/ZX123 Tool" --command -l -i flash.ZX1``)

=== ROMPack v2

ROMPack v2 files are based on classic ROMPack files, used to extract and insert all the ROM files in a ZX-Uno, ZXDOS SPI flash. Classic ROMpack files have 64 ROM slots while ROMPack v2 files have 255 ROM slots. The file structure of a ROMPAck file is as follows:

[align="center",width="75%",%header,cols="1,1,6",options="header"]
|===
